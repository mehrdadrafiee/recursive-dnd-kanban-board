# recursive-dnd-kanban-board Example

This repository provides an example of how to build a recursively generated Kanban board using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- @dnd-kit
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui

This Project is heavily inspired by [react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui](https://github.com/georgegriff/react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui). The main difference is that this project uses a recursive approach to generate the Kanban board columns, rather than a fixed number of columns. ðŸš€
